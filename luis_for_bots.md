# Setting up LUIS for Bot Framework

[LUIS](https://www.luis.ai/) is a machine learning-based service to build natural language applications.  Bots can use LUIS to help with language understanding.

Setting up LUIS can be performed in two ways:
- [Set up LUIS with MsBot](#set-up-luis-with-msbot) (Preferred method)
- [Set up LUIS with the Azure Portal](#set-up-luis-with-the-azure-portal)


## Set up LUIS with MsBot
MsBot is a command line tool that manages Bot Framework projects that use Azure.   When setting up LUIS, we demonstrate the MsBot `clone` command which takes a `.recipe` (json) file and deploys the project to Azure.  See [MsBot](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/MSBot) for more details.

### Install on Windows or macOS
1. Install the Azure CLI (if not already installed) [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

2. Install the Bot CLI Tools
```bash
npm install -g chatdown msbot ludown luis-apis qnamaker botdispatch luisgen
```

2. To login, run:
```bash
az login
```
To find out more information about logging in, see the [AZ CLI Login reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login)

3. To select your Azure subscription, run:
```bash
az account set --subscription '<azure subscription>'
```
To find out more information about setting your subscription, see the [Azure CLI Subscription Set reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-account-set).

4. Collect your Luis Authoring Key from the the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai) by selecting your name in the top right corner of the home page and select `Settings`.  Save your key for the next step.

5. Run the following command from the project directory:
```bash
msbot clone services --noDecorate --name "<bot name>" --luisAuthoringKey "<authoring key>" --folder "<folder to .recipe file>" --location "<Publish location>"
```
| Switch Name         | Description        | Example |
|---------------------|:------------------|--------:|
| name                | Name of the bot.  An Azure group will be created with this name with all the associated resources. Shorter names are preferred.| "mybot"|
| luisAuthoringKey | The authoring key in the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai). See step 4 above. | xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx |
| folder | The location of where the bot.recipe file is located (Case sensitive). | nodejs: deploymentScripts/msbotClone, ASP.Net: DeploymentScripts/MsbotClone |
| location | A supported "Publishing and Querying region" as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-regions).  | westus|

**NOTE**: By default your LUIS Applications will be deployed to your free starter endpoint. An Azure LUIS service will be deployed along with your bot but you must manually add and publish to it from the luis.ai portal and update your key in the .bot file.

6. Note the generated secret generated by MsBot. 
- The secret key is used later.  The output will look something like the following:
```bash
The secret used to decrypt <bot name>.bot is:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=
NOTE: This secret is not recoverable and you should store this secret in a secure place according to best security practices.
Your project may be configured to rely on this secret and you should update it as appropriate.
```
7. Inspect Bot configuration file.
- The `msbot clone` command above generates a bot configuration file.
- The name of the bot configuration file is <bot name>.bot, where <bot name> is the name of your bot used in the `msbot clone` step (Step 5 above).
- The configuration file can later used by the [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).

8. **(ASP.Net only)** Ensure the bot configuration is packaged with your deployment 

- For Visual Studio, in your bot project, right click on the generated bot configuration file, click "Properties".
  - Ensure "Copy to Output Directory" is set to "Copy always".
- For other editors, edit your bot's `.csproj` file and add the following:
```xml
 <ItemGroup>
    <None Update="*.bot">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </None>
  </ItemGroup>
```

9. **(ASP.Net only)** Update your `appsettings.json` with your .bot file path and .bot file secret.
- Update the `botFilePath` with the name of your generated bot configuration file.
- Update the `botFileSecret` with the secret that the msbot tool generated from step 6 above.

```bash
{
    "botFilePath": "<bot name>.bot",
    "botFileSecret": "<bot secret>"
}
```
## Set up LUIS with the Azure Portal

## Prerequisites
### Set up LUIS
- Navigate to [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).
- Click the `Sign in` button.
- Click on `My Apps`.
- Click on the `Import new app` button.
- Click on the `Choose File` and select [LUIS-Reminders.json](LUIS-Reminders.json) from the `botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\23.luis-with-appinsights\CognitiveModels` folder.
- Update [BotConfiguration.bot](BotConfiguration.bot) file with your AppId, SubscriptionKey, Region and Version. 
    You can find this information under "Publish" tab for your LUIS application at [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).  For example, for
	https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/XXXXXXXXXXXXX?subscription-key=YYYYYYYYYYYY&verbose=true&timezoneOffset=0&q= 

    - AppId = XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - SubscriptionKey = YYYYYYYYYYYY
    - Region =  westus

    The Version is listed on the page.
- Update [BotConfiguration.bot](BotConfiguration.bot) file with your Authoring Key.  
    You can find this under your user settings at [luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai).  Click on your name in the upper right hand corner of the portal, and click on the "Settings" menu option.
NOTE: Once you publish your app on LUIS portal for the first time, it takes some time for the endpoint to become available, about 5 minutes of wait should be sufficient.
### (Optional) Install LUDown
- (Optional) Install the LUDown [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/LUDown) to help describe language understanding components for your bot.
### Install Application Insights
  -  Follow instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-asp-net-core) to set up your Application Insights service.
  - Note: The Application Insights will automatically update the [appsettings.json](appsettings.json) file.

### Visual Studio
- Navigate to the samples folder (`botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\21.luis-with-appsinsights`) and open `LuisBotAppInsights.csproj` in Visual Studio 
- Hit F5

### Visual Studio Code
- Open `botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\21.luis-with-appsinsights` sample folder
- Bring up a terminal, navigate to `botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\21.luis-with-appsinsights` folder.
- Type 'dotnet run'.

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch the Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open bot and navigate to `botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\21.luis-with-appsinsights` folder.
- Select BotConfiguration.bot file.

# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. 

To install all Bot Builder tools - 

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.5 or higher

```bash
npm i -g msbot chatdown ludown qnamaker luis-apis botdispatch luisgen
```
To clone this bot, run
```
msbot clone services -f DeploymentScripts/MsbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location, ie westus> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```
