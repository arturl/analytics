# Bot Analytics v4.2

## Priority 0: DanDris Scenarios
We regularly receive issues about bots having issues and customers are left scratching their heads.  The following are considered the top issues encountered by customers bots with respect to the Channel Service:
o	500 errors on bot
o	Timeout (from channel to bot)
o	Bot Never responds 
o	Bot works in ABS (Web Chat Test) but doesnâ€™t work in channel X

In order to help customers quickly diagnose these issues (and enable UI/tools to surface to customers), the approach is to enable Application Insights for the Bot and leverage tracing from the Channel Service to completely diagnose the issues.
