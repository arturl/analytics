This sample shows how to integrate LUIS to a bot with ASP.Net Core 2. 

# To try this sample
- Clone the samples repository
​```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
​```

## Prerequisites
### Provision the LUIS Service
Before the sample can be used, the LUIS service must be provisioned.  Choose one of the following approaches to provision your bot.

#### Provision through MsBot Clone
For further information, see the [MsBot Clone overview]().

#### Provision through CLI tools
For further information, see the [ludown/luis and msbot command line tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-tools?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).

#### Provision through Azure Portal
Fo further information, see the [LUIS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/).

### Create the Bot Configuration
The .bot file contains information, including the endpoint, app ID, and password, and references to services that are used by the bot. 

The .bot file is generated automatically if the MsBot Clone process was used to provision.  Other provisioning methods require manually creating and saving the file within your project. 

The bot configuration file must be deployed with your  bot.

## Building the sample
### Visual Studio
- Navigate to the samples folder (`botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/12.nlp-with-luis`) and open `LuisBot.csproj` in Visual Studio 
- Hit F5

### Visual Studio Code
- Open `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/12.nlp-with-luis` sample folder
- Bring up a terminal, navigate to `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/12.nlp-with-luis` folder.
- Type 'dotnet run'.

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug
their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.
- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator
- Launch the Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open bot and navigate to `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/12.nlp-with-luis` folder
- Select <your bot config>.bot file that was either generated or created.
